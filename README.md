# A Google Classroom Clone
This project is a Google Classroom Clone, developed to provide a digital platform for classroom management, assignment handling, and communication between teachers and students. Using PHP and MySQL, it enables teachers to create virtual classrooms, invite students, and post assignments. Students can join classrooms, access assigned tasks, submit their work, and receive feedback. The platform provides access to teacher and student users.
